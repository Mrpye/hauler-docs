## hauler target

Used for managing target configuration

### Synopsis


Targets represent endpoints that Hauler uses to communicate with when building packages or deploying applications. Hauler follows a rule that there should be only one of each type in an environment, this way if you change environment then Hauler will be able to remap the targets.
There are cases where you may need multiple targets of the same group type, this can be achieved by using the action target override feature.

Below is a table of supported groups and targets along with when they are used, e.g when a package is build or application is deployed.

|Group      |Target    |Build |Deploy |

|Git        |GitHub    |Yes   |No     |
